# Text-Generation
Generated text using a word-based Recurrent Neural Network. Worked on the data present in the book Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-0.txt). Given a sequence of words from this data, trained a model to predict the most likely word to come next in the sequence.
